This study pioneers the application of Huffman coding to compress genetic data, drawing an analogy to a musical composition. By scrutinizing the frequency of each DNA base symbol, the genetic landscape is unveiled. Painstakingly constructing a Huffman tree, akin to composing a symphony, results in a binary representationâ€”a unique genetic tune. Different Huffman codes assign distinct sequences to each DNA symbol, akin to musical notes. The compression process, like a beautiful metamorphosis, yields a refined binary work, significantly reducing data volume. This harmonious fusion of computational prowess and biological understanding not only enables efficient storage and transfer but also marks a groundbreaking advancement in genetic data administration.

***Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.
